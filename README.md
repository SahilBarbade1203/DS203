# Data-Driven Architectural Design Optimization
DS203 - Programming in Data Science

# Project Overview:
The architecture company embarked on a digitalization initiative to transform their building layout designs into digital formats. With a repository of 1183 building layouts captured as bitmaps, they sought to harness the power of data science and machine learning to enhance productivity, streamline design processes, and extract valuable insights hidden within the data.

# Approach:

Shape-Based Clustering: Employed two distinct approaches to group designs into families based on their shapes. Utilized techniques such as contour analysis and clustering algorithms to categorize designs effectively.

Complexity Classification: Conducted a formal analysis to classify layouts into Low, Medium, and High complexity categories. Defined criteria based on various parameters like the number of vertices, contour area, and bounding box area.

Layout Retrieval System: Developed a system to expedite layout design by predicting relevant design families based on user-specified parameters like dimensions, layout area, and complexity. This system enables architects to retrieve similar past designs efficiently.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized OpenCV for image processing, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

# Applications:
Architectural Design: Enhances insights into design patterns, facilitates standardization through design templates, and expedites the layout design process by retrieving relevant past designs.

Civil Construction: Streamlines construction planning and execution by providing insights into layout complexities, optimizing resource allocation, and minimizing design iterations.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Empowers architects with data-driven insights to make informed decisions, improve design efficiency, and respond effectively to customer requirements.
